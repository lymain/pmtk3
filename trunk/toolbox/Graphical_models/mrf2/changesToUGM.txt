- if you change line 62 of example_UGM_Condition from @UGM_Decode_Tree
to @UGM_Decode_Chain, it breaks, even though the model is a chain.
The reason is that conditioning on one node results in 57 edge
potentials but 59 node potentials (for a chain of length 60).
The tree code can handle this but not the chain code.

Similarly, if you change line 115 of example_UGM_TrainCRF
to read 'clamped(3:4) = 2'; instead of 'clamped(1:2)=2' it crashes.


- UGM_Decode_ICMrestart : it used to ignore the nRestarts argument.
     Also, now on the first try it uses the max of the nodePot as its
     initial guess (same as UGM_Decode_ICM)

- IGM_Infer_TRBP: the C version is missing, so I modified the .m file
 so it doesn't call the C version
