See pmtk3.googlecode.com for details.


This version (28 Feb 2011) has been tested (in the weak sense that the
'runDemos' command runs to completion) on the 
configurations described below,
where we use the following abbreviations:

 +- opt : including / excluding Mathworks optimization toolbox
 +- stats : including / excluding Mathworks statistics toolbox
 +- image : including / excluding Mathworks image processing toolbox
 +- bio : including / excluding Mathworks bioinformatics toolbox
 +- gviz:  including / excluding graphviz
 +- libdai:  including / excluding libdai (not compiled to maci64)

(If packages are missing, some demos may be skipped.)
