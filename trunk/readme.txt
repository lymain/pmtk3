Run initPmtk3() to initialize PMTK3 on your system. 
Consider adding this to your startup file, or creating a MATLAB shortcut. 

Many of the demos require data sets available here: 
http://code.google.com/p/pmtkdata/

Download these and add the directory to your MATLAB path with e.g.
addpath(genpathPMTK('C:\pmtkData')); 

A few demos require the graphViz4Matlab package available here:
http://code.google.com/p/graphviz4matlab/

You can test that PMTK is correctly installed by running testPmtk3(). 

To get started, see the demos directory for hundreds of PMTK3 demos, and
