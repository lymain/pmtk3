Run initPmtk3() to initialize PMTK3 on your system. 
Consider adding this to your startup file, or creating a MATLAB shortcut. 

You can test that PMTK is correctly installed by running testPmtk3(). 

For more information, view the online documentation at
   http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/pmtk3Documentation

A few demos require the graphViz4Matlab package available from
   http://code.google.com/p/graphviz4matlab/

Many of the demos require data sets available from
   http://code.google.com/p/pmtkdata/
However, data will be automatically downloaded as needed,
and stored locally in pmtk3/data
