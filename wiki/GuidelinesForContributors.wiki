#summary Best practices to follow when contributing code to PMTK3

When you contribute code, please follow these guidelines
  * Please contribute demos and/or new functionality.

 * Follow the general Matlab programming style guidelines [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/matlabTutorial/html/style.html here].

  * Follow the guidelines on writing demos [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/writingDemos here]. Then, when publishDemos() is called, it will  make nice web pages, such as those listed [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/Demos here], 

  * Use PMTKauthor, PMTKurl, PMTKdate tags so that your code is automatically detected by makeAuthorReport, which generates [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/contributingAuthors this page]

  * Use the debugDemos.m command, which creates a list  [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/debugReport.html like this], to make sure your demos keep working. 

  * See [http://code.google.com/p/pmtkdata/wiki/GuidelinesForContributors this page] for details on adding data sets.
