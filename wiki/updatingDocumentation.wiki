#summary Information about updating the PMTK3 documentation

Documentation for PMTK3 is generated by the following scripts. 

Most of these scripts rely on hard coded, user dependent paths set in the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/config.txt config.txt] file; make sure these are correct before running the scripts. If you have a config-local.txt file, any listed property value pairs override those in config.txt. 

All of these scripts require Matlab, and will probably not work under Octave. They have only been tested on 32 bit windows, Matlab version 2010a.

The acronym 'PML' below stands for 'Probabilistic Machine Learning',
which is shorthand for 
[http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/index.html my book]. Functions with the string PML in them can only be run by users who have access to the book's latex source.

Remember to do an svn checkin after (re)generating the documentation.

|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/reports/publishTutorial.m publishTutorial] || This script generates the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/Tutorial pmtk tutorial] pages. It uses  [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/reports/pmtkPublish.m pmtkPublish.m], which is like the built-in publish command, except it first expands pmtk filenames into their googlecode urls. ||
|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/reports/publishDemos.m publishDemos] || This script should be run overnight as it can take several hours to complete. It updates [Demos these tables] and republishes all of the demos. If you only want to regenerate the tables, and not rerun the demos (thus taking only a minute), set wikiOnly to true at the top of the file. This script interacts with PML to determine on which pages in the book the demos are referenced. PML must be fully compiled. publishDemos calls the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/reports/sub/publishFolder.m publishFolder] function to publish each demo folder. You can use this to republish a single folder; see it for additional defaults such as tag based exclusions. If the demos directory structure has changed significantly, delete the contents of docs/demoOutput first.||
|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/reports/generateAuthorReport.m generateAuthorReport] || This script takes about 30 seconds to run, and generates [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/authors/fileAuthors.html this table] of contributed files. ||
|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/reports/generateAuthorLocReport.m generateAuthorLocReport] || This script takes about 30 seconds to run, and generates [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/authors/authorsLOC.html this table], showing the lines of code contributed by various authors. ||
|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/supportTools/generateSupportReport.m generateSupportReport] || This script takes only a few seconds to run, and generates [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/authors/packageAuthors.html this table] of supporting packages. You must have a local copy of the pmtkSupport [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/source/checkout svn repository]. The html report is stored in the pmtkSupport repository. See [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/wiki/addingNewPackages this page] for details on adding and updating packages.||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/reports/generatePmtkStats.m generatePmtkStats] || This script takes about 30 seconds to run, and generates [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/pmtkStats.html this table]. ||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/reports/generateSynopses.m generateSynopses] || This script takes about 10 seconds to run, and generates [synopsisPages these tables]. ||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/dataTools/generatePmtkDataTable.m generatePmtkDataTable] || This script about 30 seconds to run, generating [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/dataTable.html this table]. You must have a local copy of the [http://pmtkData.googlecode.com pmtkData] svn repository. The html table is stored in the pmtkData repository. See [http://code.google.com/p/pmtkdata/wiki/GuidelinesForContributors this page] for details on adding new data sets.||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/testing/debugDemos.m debugDemos] || debugDemos runs most of the demos, capturing warnings and errors along the way. Figures generated by these demos are not displayed. The scripts runs in about 20 minutes depending on the exclusion tags at the top of the file. You must always exclude PMTKinteractive. It generates [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/debugReport.html this table] . ||
|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/pml/pmlMissingCodeReport.m pmlMissingCodeReport] || This script generates an html table of code referenced in PML that can not be found. It includes the page numbers on which the code is referenced. Like publishDemos above, this script uses [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/pml/pmlChapterPages.m pmlChapterPages], and [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil//pml/pmlCodeRefs.m pmlCodeRefs] to parse the latex code.ind, and pml.toc files. PML must be fully compiled. ||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/pml/pmlUnusedDemoReport.m pmlUnusedDemoReport] || This script generates a list of all PMTK3 demos that are not referenced in PML. It has the same requirements as pmlMissingCodeReport above. ||
|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/pml/pmlFigureCodeReport.m pmlFigureCodeReport]|| This takes a few minutes to run and generates an html table of all of the figures in PML along with links to the images and source files. PML must not have any syntax errors, (i.e. it must be compilable) and all figures in the book must be added using the \add*fig(s) macros, (otherwise the numbering gets thrown off). Missing source files are also recorded, and the above pmlMissingCodeReport is also called. All files are packed up into a new directory structure. ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/browse/trunk/localUtil/reports/generateModelsVsMethodsTables.m generateModelsVsMethodsTables] || This script takes a few seconds to run and generates [ModelsByMethods these tables] showing PMTK models and the methods they support. Models are included and grouped according to the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/localUtil/reports/classNameMappings.m classNameMappings.m] file.  The 'methods' are inferred based on toolbox file names that begin with a known model name. The script also includes a list of excluded directories such as sub, which are not searched.  ||
|| [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/browse/trunk/localUtil/reports/generateModelLists.m generateModelLists.m] || This script takes about a minute to run and generates [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/modelLists these tables] listing the models in PMTK. The script looks for PMTKdefn tags in model constructors, formats the latex text it finds, and embeds the generated image into the table. It will error if the text found is invalid latex code. The text is automatically surrounded by $ symbols if not present. ||

publishDemos, and generateSynopses both update their respective wiki pages automatically. For this to work, you need to have a locally checked out copy of the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/browse/#svn/wiki wiki branch] of the svn repository. Remember to check in changes made to this local wiki repository after running these scripts.
