#summary Information about updating the PMTK3 documentation

Documentation for PMTK3 is generated by the following scripts. See [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/browse/#svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools  /misc/metatools/docTools] for supporting files.

|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools/publishDemos.m publishDemos] || This script should be run overnight as it can take several hours to complete. It updates [Demos these tables] and republishes all of the demos. If you only want to regenerate the tables, and not rerun the demos (much faster), set wikiOnly to true at the top of the file. This script interacts with PML to determine on which pages in the book the demos are referenced. PML must be fully compiled and the paths in [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/pml/pmlChapterPages.m pmlChapterPages], and [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/pml/pmlCodeRefs.m pmlCodeRefs] must be correct. publishDemos calls the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools/publishFolder.m publishFolder] function to publish each demo folder. You can use this to republish a single folder; see it for additional defaults.||
|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools/generateAuthorReport.m generateAuthorReport] || This script takes 30 seconds to run, and generates [contributingAuthors these tables]. ||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools/generatePmtkStats.m generatePmtkStats] || This script takes about 30 seconds to run, and generates [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/pmtkStats.html this table]. ||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools/generateSynopses.m generateSynopses] || This script takes about 10 seconds to run, and generates [synopsisPages these tables]. ||

publishDemos, and generateSynopses both update their respective wiki pages automatically. For this to work, you need to have a locally checked out copy of the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/browse/#svn/wiki wiki branch] of the svn repository. Check the tops of these files to make sure the paths to this directory are correct. Remember to check in changes made to this local wiki repository after running these scripts.
