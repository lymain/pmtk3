#summary Information about updating the PMTK3 documentation

Documentation for PMTK3 is generated by the following scripts. See [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/browse/#svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools  /misc/metatools/docTools] for supporting files.

|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools/publishDemos.m publishDemos] || This script should be run overnight as it can take several hours to complete. It updates [Demos these tables] and republishes all of the demos. If you only want to regenerate the tables, and not rerun the demos (thus taking only a minute), set wikiOnly to true at the top of the file. This script interacts with PML to determine on which pages in the book the demos are referenced. PML must be fully compiled and the paths in [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/pml/pmlChapterPages.m pmlChapterPages], and [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/pml/pmlCodeRefs.m pmlCodeRefs] must be correct. These files parse the latex code.ind, and pml.toc files respectively. publishDemos calls the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools/publishFolder.m publishFolder] function to publish each demo folder. You can use this to republish a single folder; see it for additional defaults such as tag based exclusions.||
|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools/generateAuthorReport.m generateAuthorReport] || This script takes 30 seconds to run, and generates [contributingAuthors these tables]. ||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools/generatePmtkStats.m generatePmtkStats] || This script takes about 30 seconds to run, and generates [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/pmtkStats.html this table]. ||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/docTools/generateSynopses.m generateSynopses] || This script takes about 10 seconds to run, and generates [synopsisPages these tables]. ||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/dataTools/generatePmtkDataTable.m generatePmtkDataTable] || This script about 30 seconds to run, generating [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dataTable.html this table]. You must have a local copy of the [http://pmtkData.googlecode.com pmtkData] svn repository and specify the path to that directory when running the script. The html table is stored in the pmtkData repository.||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/debugDemos.m debugDemos] || debugDemos runs most of the demos, capturing warnings and errors along the way. Figures generated by these demos are not displayed. The scripts runs in about 20 minutes depending on the exclusion tags at the top of the file. You must always exclude PMTKinteractive. It generates [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/debugReport.html this table] . ||
|| [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/pml/pmlMissingCodeReport.m pmlMissingCodeReport] || This script generates an html table of code referenced in PML that can not be found. It includes the page numbers on which the code is referenced. Like publishDemos above, this script uses [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/pml/pmlChapterPages.m pmlChapterPages], and [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/pml/pmlCodeRefs.m pmlCodeRefs] to parse the latex code.ind, and pml.toc files. PML must be fully compiled and you must specify the path to the PML directory to the script. ||
||[http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/pml/pmlUnusedDemoReport.m pmlUnusedDemoReport] || This script generates a list of all PMTK3 demos that are not referenced in PML. It has the same requirements as pmlMissingCodeReport above. ||
|| pmlSourceFileReport || _details to follow_ ||

publishDemos, and generateSynopses both update their respective wiki pages automatically. For this to work, you need to have a locally checked out copy of the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/browse/#svn/wiki wiki branch] of the svn repository. Check the tops of these files to make sure the paths to this directory are correct. Remember to check in changes made to this local wiki repository after running these scripts. 

_All of these scripts require Matlab, and will not work under Octave._
