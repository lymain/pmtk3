= Writing Demos =

Demos in PMTK3 are automatically published to html using the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/misc/metatools/publishDemos.m publishDemos()] function. To ensure that these demos look nice, please format the comments as follows:

== Title == 

Every demo should have a title. This will appear in two places, the list of demos by chapter, and at the top of the demo itself. 

  * The title must be a single line, and the very first line of the file, above even the    function header. 
  * The title line must begin with two % signs, as in {{{%% Demo Title Here}}}.
  * Additional comments that pertain to the whole demo should immediately follow the title  without any blank lines and beginning with single % signs. 
  * This comment block, even if empty, must end with two %% signs before the first line of Matlab code.
