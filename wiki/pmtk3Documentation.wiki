#summary Root documentation page for PMTK3

= Installation =

  * [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/downloads/list Download] the latest pmtk3 zip file and unzip it say to "C:\pmtk3" or "~/pmtk3". 

  * If you are running Matlab 2008a or newer, you can optionally install [http://code.google.com/p/graphviz4matlab/ graphViz4Matlab]; this is used by some of the demos to visualize learned graph structures.
 
  * Start Matlab/Octave. Then type
{{{
cd C:\pmtk3
initPmtk3
}}}
  * To test the system, type
{{{
testPmtk3
}}}
(If you have more patience, you can try 'runDemos')


PMTK3 demos automatically download required [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dataTable.html data sets] as needed. This feature requires perl, which comes with all MATLAB installations and linux distributions. If you are running Octave under windows, you may need to [http://www.perl.com/download.csp install perl], or download the data manually from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtkdata/downloads/list here], and add it to the pmtk3\data directory.
