Explanation of directory structure of PMTK3

PMTK3 contains the following top-level directories
(as of 28Feb11):

  * toolbox - the main directory containing models and algorithms. Click [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/synopsisPages here] for a list of all the files within this folder, complete with brief documentation

  * matlabTools - various generally useful matlab functions

 * pmtkTools - various utility functions that are specific to pmtk3

  * demos - various demos that test and illustrate how to use the toolbox. Many are just scripts used to generate figures for [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/index.html "Machine learning : a probabilistic approach"]. 

  * docs - contains documentation which appears on [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com pmtk3.googlecode.com]. For most users this will be an empty directory

  * pmtkSupportCopy - used to store local copies of folders that are auto-downloaded from [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com pmtksupport.googlecode.com]. This will be initially empty and gets filled after running initPmtk3.


  * pmtkdataCopy - used to store local copies of data folders that are auto-downloaded from [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com pmtkdata.googlecode.com]. This will be initially empty and gradually gets filled after running loadData.

  * pmtkdataSmall - used to store small files for which it is not worth the effort to put them on the  pmtkdata website
