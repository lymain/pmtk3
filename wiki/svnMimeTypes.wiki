#summary This page describes how to set default svn mime types

Since we host html pages from svn repository, it is important to get the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type mime types] correct, otherwise the pages will be displayed as plain text. If you are using the [http://tortoisesvn.net/ tortoise SVN client] for windows, follow these steps:

  # Right click on a directory and select TortoiseSVN --> Settings
  # Press the edit button under "General" "Subversion" "Subversion configuration file:"
  # Add or modify these lines and save the file.

*.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
