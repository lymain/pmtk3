PMTK3 is a collection of functions for fitting probabilistic models to data,
and then using these models to make inferences/ predictions about unknown
quantities. A large variety of models, fitting and inference algorithms are 
supported. However, we have tried to ensure that the interface is fairly
similar for all of them. We give some of the details below.
