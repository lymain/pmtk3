#summary Tutorial on PMTK3


(These are draft notes on how to use PMTK3.
*The interface is currently undergoing many changes, so
these notes may be inconsistent with the code*
Everything should be stable by the end of August 2010.)

PMTK3 is a collection of functions for fitting probabilistic models to data,
and then using these models to make inferences/ predictions about unknown
quantities. A large variety of models, fitting and inference algorithms are 
supported. However, we have tried to hide these details behind a simple, uniform interface. More details can be found by following the links below.
