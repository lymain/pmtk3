#summary Tutorial on PMTK3


These are draft notes on how to use PMTK3.
The interface is currently undergoing many changes, so these notes
may be inconsistent with the code... stay tuned!

PMTK3 is a collection of functions for fitting probabilistic models to data,
and then using these models to make inferences/ predictions about unknown
quantities. A large variety of models, fitting and inference algorithms are 
supported. However, we have tried to hide these details behind a simple, uniform interface. More details can be found by following the links below.
