#summary A discussion of mex files in PMTK

PMTK includes a few mex files, which are Matlab interfaces to compiled c code that can be executed as though they were regular .m files. Mex files must be generated for each type of OS. Currently we have only included 32 bit linux, and windows versions. If you are using another OS, the vast majority of PMTK should still function fine. Many 'backup' .m files exist, which are called automatically if a mex version cannot be found. 

If you run into problems, however, you may need to compile files manually. Here are some pointers. 

  * Before you run the {{{ mex }}} command for the first time, you need to type {{{ mex -setup }}} to tell Matlab what compiler to use. This only has to be done once per Matlab installation. 

  * For standalone .c or .cpp files, (which do not link to other libraries), compilation is very easy. Suppose the file is called foo.c. Change to the directory containing foo.c, using {{{ cd }}}, and then type {{{ mex foo.c }}}.

  * If Matlab complains that your compiler is too new(!) see [http://www.infohit.net/blog/post/alternative-gcc-compilers-on-ubuntu-intrepid-and-jaunty.html this page] on downgrading gcc on ubuntu. 

  * Some versions of Matlab do not ship with a compiler. If this is the case, you can install the visual studio express 2008 C++ compiler available for free from [http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/ here]. Note, Matlab does not currently support the 2010 edition.

  * Compiling on a 64 bit windows system requires additional setup - see [http://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers/R2010a/win64.html this page] for details. 

  * Some packages found in [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/ pmtkSupport] may require custom mex commands. See their documentation for details, or look for an installation script. 

  * If you do generate mex files for another OS, please send them to us so that we can include them in for others to use.
