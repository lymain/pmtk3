PMTK includes code written by various other people (besides Matt Dunham and Kevin Murphy). The following entries are auto-generated by generateAuthorReport.m, which relies on the contributed files containing PMTKauthor, PMTKurl, and PMTKdate tags. (In the case of packages (i.e., collections of files), these tags should be stored in the Contents.m file.) If we have included one of your files but we forgot to include a relevant tag, please let us know. (The licenses under which various contributed packages are distributed will be clarified later.)
