#summary Installation instructions for pmtk3

  * Download the latest zip file from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/downloads/list pmtk3], and unzip it. Assume the directory where you unzipped it is called 'C:\pmtk3' (Note: the zip file may not be up to date - use the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/checkout svn interface] to get the latest version.)

  * If you are running Matlab 2008a or newer, you can optionally install [http://www.graphviz.org/ graphViz]; this is used by the [http://code.google.com/p/graphviz4matlab/ graphViz4Matlab] interface to visualize learned graph structures in some of the demos. 
 
  * Start Matlab/Octave. Then type the following (you will need to modify the directory names if you unzipped these files to a different place).
{{{
cd C:\pmtk3
initPmtk3
}}}

  * To test the system, type
{{{
testPmtk3
}}}
(If you have more patience, you can try 'runDemos')


PMTK3 demos automatically download required [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dataTable.html data sets] as needed. This feature requires perl, which comes with all MATLAB installations and linux distributions. If you are running Octave under windows, you may need to [http://www.perl.com/download.csp install perl], or download the data manually from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtkdata/downloads/list here], and add it to the pmtk3\data directory. Alternatively, you can check out the data from the
[http://pmtkData.googlecode.com pmtkData svn repository].

PMTK3 [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/authors/packageAuthors.html support packages] are automatically downloaded by [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/initPmtk3.m initPmtk3] if not found. These can also be manually downloaded [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/downloads/list here].
