#summary Installation instructions for pmtk3
== Installation ==

  * Download the latest zip file from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/downloads/list here], and unzip it. Alternatively, you can use the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/checkout svn interface] to get the latest version of the source code, although this may not be as stable as the zip version.
 
 * Start Matlab/Octave. Suppose the directory where you unzipped pmtk is called 'C:\pmtk3'. Then type the following (you will need to modify the directory names if you unzipped these files to a different place).
{{{
cd C:\pmtk3
initPmtk3
}}}
 This command will automatically download various supporting packages if they are not   already on your path (see below for details), so may take about 30 seconds. _If you are using Octave, this may take much longer, and you might not see status updates while the packages are being downloaded._

 * To test the system, type
{{{
testPmtk3
}}}
 This command will check the packages are installed correctly, and automatically downloads a few datasets if they are not already on your path (see below for details), and then runs a few demos; this takes about a minute. If you have more patience, you can try 'runDemos' which takes about 20 minutes, or 'runAllDemos', which may take hours. The output produced by running all these demos is shown [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/Demos here].

Note that not all tests currently pass in Octave. 

  * The [http://graphviz4matlab.googlecode.com graphViz4Matlab] package, which is included in pmtkSupport, can be used to visualize (and edit) network structures. For best results, you should install the latest (free) version of  [http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php Graphviz]. This feature requires you to have Matlab 2008a or newer. It is not necessary to have this to use pmtk, but it is useful if you want to visualize the results of graphical model structure learning. After installation, check the path to the `Graphviz*\bin` directory in the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/config.txt config.txt] file, or add this directory to your [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/addtosystempath.m system path] manually. On windows systems this is usually `C:\program files\Graphviz2.26\bin`. Ubuntu/Debian users can install graphviz by typing {{{sudo apt-get install graphviz}}} at the command prompt. 

== Automatic downloads ==

  * PMTK3 demos use various [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/dataTable.html data sets]. These are automatically downloaded from [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com] by the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/dataTools/loadData.m loadData] command whenever a demo needs them. (Once downloaded, the files are stored locally in the 'data' directory and added to your path, so next time the local copy is used.) 
 
  * PMTK3 relies on various [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/authors/packageAuthors.html support packages]. These are automatically downloaded from [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com] by [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/initPmtk3.m initPmtk3] if they are not already on your path. (Once downloaded, the files are stored locally in the 'external' directory and added to your path, so the next time the local copy is used.) Unlike the data sets, the support packages are downloaded all at once, not on demand. 

  * PMTK3 makes extensive use of the [http://code.google.com/p/matlabtools/ matlabTools] package, which is also automatically downloaded by [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/initPmtk3.m initPmtk3] if not already on your path. 

  * For speed, you can download all of the data sets at once using [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/dataTools/downloadAllData.m downloadAllData], or check them out of the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtkdata/source/checkout svn repository] directly. You can also download the support packages to a custom directory using [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/downloadAllSupport.m downloadAllSupport]. If you have specified custom directories for pmtkData or pmtkSupport you should edit the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/config.txt config.txt] file to specify the location of these directories. Then initPmtk3 will automatically add them to your path, and won't download anything. 

== Libdai interface ==

PMTK3 includes an optional interface to the [http://people.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/jorism/libDAI/ libdai] C++ inference package. We have compiled a windows 32 bit version of libdai, which is available for manual download [http://code.google.com/p/pmtklibdai/ here]. This is not automatically downloaded due to its large size. It is relatively easy to compile on linux. Instructions can be found [http://people.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/jorism/libDAI/doc/build.html here].

Once downloaded / installed, open the PMTK3 [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/config.txt config.txt] file in the root PMTK3 directory, and modify the libdai file path accordingly so that PMTK knows where to find it. For example, if you saved libdai to {{{C:\libdai}}}, the config line should look like this:

{{{% PMTKlibdaiPath C:\libdai}}}

Run {{{initPmtk3}}} again after making the change.
