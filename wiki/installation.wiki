#summary Installation instructions for pmtk3

  * Download the latest zip file from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/downloads/list here], and unzip it. Alternatively, you can use the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/checkout svn interface] to get the latest version of the source code, although this may not be as stable as the zip version.
 
 * Start Matlab/Octave. Suppose the directory where you unzipped pmtk is called 'C:\pmtk3'. Then type the following (you will need to modify the directory names if you unzipped these files to a different place).
{{{
cd C:\pmtk3
initPmtk3
}}}
  
 * To test the system, type
{{{
testPmtk3
}}}
 If you have more patience, you can try 'runDemos'

  * PMTK3 demos use various [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dataTable.html data sets]. These are automatically downloaded from [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com] by the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/dataTools/loadData.m loadData] command whenever a demo needs them. (Once downloaded, the files are stored locally in the 'data' directory and added to your path, so next time the local copy is used.) 
 
  * PMTK3 relies on various [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/authors/packageAuthors.html support packages]. These are automatically downloaded from [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com] by [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/initPmtk3.m initPmtk3] if they are not already on your path. (Once downloaded, the files are stored locally in the 'external' directory and added to your path, so the next time the local copy is used.)

  * The [http://graphviz4matlab.googlecode.com graphViz4Matlab] package, which is included in pmtkSupport, can be used to visualize (and edit) network structures. For best results, you should install the latest (free) version of  [http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php Graphviz]. This feature requires you to have Matlab 2008a or newer. It is not necessary to have this to use pmtk, but it is useful if you want to visualize the results of graphical model structure learning. After installation, check the path to the `Graphviz*\bin` directory in the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/config.txt config.txt] file, or add this directory to your [http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/configuration/how-can-i-add-a-new-folder-to-my-system-path-.aspx _system_ path] manually. On windows systems this is usually `C:\program files\Graphviz2.26\bin`.

  * PMTK's automatic download feature requires perl, which comes with all MATLAB installations and linux distributions. If you are running Octave under windows, you may need to [http://www.perl.com/download.csp install perl] first.

  * If you cannot get automatic download to work, you can download the data manually from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtkdata/downloads/list here], unzip it, and add them to the pmtk3\data directory. Also, you can manually download the support packages  from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/downloads/list here], unzip them, and add them to pmtk3\external. 

  * If you have a local copy of pmtkData and pmtkSupport, you can edit the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/config.txt config.txt] file to specify the location of these directories. Then initPmtk3 will automatically add them to your path, and won't download anything. (The entries in the config file with the string 'PML' are related to my textbook, and can be ignored.)
