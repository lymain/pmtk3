#summary Installation instructions for pmtk3

  * Download the latest zip file from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/downloads/list pmtk3], and unzip it. (Note: the zip file may not be up to date - use the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/checkout svn interface] to get the latest version.)  
 
 * Start Matlab/Octave. Suppose the directory where you unzipped pmtk is called 'C:\pmtk3'. Then type the following (you will need to modify the directory names if you unzipped these files to a different place).
{{{
cd C:\pmtk3
initPmtk3
}}}
  
 * To test the system, type
{{{
testPmtk3
}}}
If you have more patience, you can try 'runDemos'

  * PMTK3 demos use various [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dataTable.html data sets]. These are automatically downloaded by the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/metatools/dataTools/loadData.m loadData] command whenever a demo needs them. (Once downloaded, the files are stored locally in the 'data' directory and added to your path, so next time the local copy is used.) 
 
  * PMTK3 relies on various [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/authors/packageAuthors.html support packages]. These are automatically downloaded by [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/initPmtk3.m initPmtk3] if they are not already on your path. (Once downloaded, the files are stored locally in the 'external' directory and added to your path, so the next time the local copy is used.)

  * The [http://graphviz4matlab.googlecode.com graphViz4Matlab] package, which is included in pmtkSupport, can be used to visualize (and edit) network structures. For best results, you should install the latest (free) version of  [http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php Graphviz]. This feature requires you to have Matlab 2008a or newer.

  * PMTK's automatic download feature requires perl, which comes with all MATLAB installations and linux distributions. If you are running Octave under windows, you may need to [http://www.perl.com/download.csp install perl] first.

  * If you cannot get automatic download to work, you can download the data manually from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtkdata/downloads/list here], unzip it, and add them to the pmtk3\data directory. Also, you can manually download the support packages  from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/downloads/list here], unzip them, and add them to pmtk3\external. You will then need to manually run the commands `addpath(genpathPMTK('C:/pmtk3/data'))` and `addpath(genpathPMTK('C:/pmtk3/external'))`. (The genpathPMTK command is like the built-in genpath command, except it excludes irrelevant folders such as those created by svn.)
