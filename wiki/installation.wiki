#summary Installation instructions for pmtk3
== Installation ==

  * Download the latest zip file from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/downloads/list here], and unzip it. Alternatively, you can use the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/checkout svn interface] to get the latest version of the source code, although this may not be as stable as the zip version.
 
 * Start Matlab/Octave. Suppose the directory where you unzipped pmtk is called 'C:\pmtk3'. Then type the following (you will need to modify the directory names if you unzipped these files to a different place).
{{{
cd C:\pmtk3
initPmtk3
}}}
 This command will automatically download various supporting packages if they are not   already on your path (see below for details), so may take about 30 seconds. _If you are using Octave, this may take much longer._

 * To test the system, type
{{{
testPmtk3
}}}
 This command will check the packages are installed correctly, and automatically downloads a few datasets if they are not already on your path (see below for details), and then runs a few demos; this takes about a minute. If you have more patience, you can try 'runDemos' which takes about 45 minutes, or 'runAllDemos', which may take hours. The output produced by running all these demos is shown [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/Demos here]. 


== Automatic downloads ==

  * PMTK3 demos use various [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/dataTable.html data sets]. These are automatically downloaded from [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com] by the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/dataTools/loadData.m loadData] command whenever a demo needs them. (Once downloaded, the files are stored locally in the 'data' directory and added to your path, so next time the local copy is used.) 
 
  * PMTK3 relies on various [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/authors/packageAuthors.html support packages]. These are automatically downloaded from [http://pmtksupport.googlecode.com] by [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/initPmtk3.m initPmtk3] if they are not already on your path. (Once downloaded, the files are stored locally in the 'external' directory and added to your path, so the next time the local copy is used.) Unlike the data sets, the support packages are downloaded all at once, not on demand. 

  * PMTK3 makes extensive use of the [http://code.google.com/p/matlabtools/ matlabTools] package, which is also automatically downloaded by [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/initPmtk3.m initPmtk3] if not already on your path. 

  * For speed, you can download all of the data sets at once using [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/dataTools/downloadAllData.m downloadAllData], or check them out of the [http://code.google.com/p/pmtkdata/source/checkout svn repository] directly. You can also download the support packages to a custom directory using [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/downloadAllSupport.m downloadAllSupport]. If you have specified custom directories for pmtkData or pmtkSupport you should edit the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/config.txt config.txt] file to specify the location of these directories. Then initPmtk3 will automatically add them to your path, and won't download anything. 


== Mex files ==

  * Most of PMTK is written in Matlab, so should run on any system. However, a few functions also have C versions, or only have C versions, for speed. We have included precompiled versions of these files. See [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/mexFiles this page] for details on recompiling them, if necessary. 

== Libdai interface ==

  * PMTK3 includes an optional interface to the [http://people.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/jorism/libDAI/ libdai] graphical model inference package, written in C++ by Joris Mooij. We have compiled windows (32bit and 64bit), and (ubuntu) linux 32 bit versions of libdai, which are included in [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/ pmtkSupport], and hence automatically available. Users of other systems will need to compile libdai manually. You can find libdai's installation instructions [http://people.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/jorism/libDAI/doc/build.html here], and our notes on compiling libdai for windows [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/compilingLibdai here]. Once compiled, add the {{{*.mex*}}} files from libdai's matlab subfolder to the pmtkSupport libdai directory. If you generate mex files for other OS's, please send them to us so that we can include them for others to use. 

== Graphviz == 

  * The [http://graphviz4matlab.googlecode.com graphViz4Matlab] package, which is included in pmtkSupport, can be used to visualize (and edit) network structures. For best results, you should install the latest (free) version of  [http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php Graphviz]. This feature requires you to have Matlab 2008a or newer. It is not necessary to have this to use pmtk, but it is useful if you want to visualize the results of graphical model structure learning, and/or run some of the demos. After installation, check the path to the `Graphviz*\bin` directory in the [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/config.txt config.txt] file, or add this directory to your [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/toolbox/metatools/addtosystempath.m system path] manually. On windows systems this is usually `C:\program files\Graphviz2.26\bin`. Ubuntu/Debian users can install graphviz by typing {{{sudo apt-get install graphviz}}} at the command prompt. 



== Troubleshooting ==

  * Octave does not always seem to include the current working directory on the path. You may need to type e.g. {{{addpath('C:\pmtk3')}}}, before typing {{{initPmtk3}}}. It also doesn't seem to like spaces in file paths. 

  * Octave users on windows systems need to have an unzip.exe file on the system path. If you don't, you can download one from [http://www.info-zip.org/ info-zip], or use this [http://pmtk3.googlecode.com/files/unzip.exe 32bit version] from our site. Whatever unzip program you use, it must be called "unzip" and be on your _system_ path. 

  * Octave under linux can sometimes fail to include all the of the necessary directories after the call to initPmtk3. If this happens you may need to manually type {{{restoredefaultpath(); addpath(genpath(pwd))}}} after running initPmtk3() for the first time, and then {{{addpath(genpath(pwd))}}} subsequent times instead of {{{initPmtk3}}}. 

  * initPmtk3 looks for the presence of two files to determine if it should auto-download: {{{matlatToolsRoot.m}}}, and {{{pmtkSupportRoot.m}}}. If you run into problems, or want to  make sure you are using the most current version of matlabTools, or pmtkSupport, remove these files, and rerun initPmtk3. 

  * PMTK is not yet 100% octave compatible. If you run into problems in Octave, check out [http://code.google.com/p/yagtom/wiki/Octave this wiki] page, or [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/wiki/mexFiles this page] on mex files. If you would like to help make PMTK more compatible on Octave, please request svn write permission by sending Kevin Murphy an e-mail.
