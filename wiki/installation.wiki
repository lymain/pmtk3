Installation instructions for pmtk3



  * Download the latest zip file from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtksupport/downloads/list pmtkSupport], and unzip it. Assume the directory where you unzipped it is called 'C:\pmtkSupport'
  
  * Download the latest zip file from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/downloads/list pmtk3], and unzip it. Assume the directory where you unzipped it is called 'C:\pmtk3'
(Note: the zip file may not be up to date - use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pmtk3/source/checkout"> svn interface</a> to get the latest version.)

  * If you are running Matlab 2008a or newer, you can optionally install [http://code.google.com/p/graphviz4matlab/ graphViz4Matlab]; this is used by some of the demos to visualize learned graph structures.  Assume the directory where you unzipped it is called 'C:\graphviz4matlab'
 
  * Start Matlab/Octave. Then type the following (you will need to modify the directory names if you unzipped these files to a different place).
{{{
addpath(genpath('C:\pmtkSupport'))
addpath(genpath('C:\graphviz4matlab'))
cd C:\pmtk3
initPmtk3
}}}
It is important that you run initPmtk3 last, since this adds PMTK3 to your path
and may shadow any older functions on your path (e.g., some functions inside pmtkSupport have been replaced with newer versions).

  * To test the system, type
{{{
testPmtk3
}}}
(If you have more patience, you can try 'runDemos')


PMTK3 demos automatically download required [http://pmtkdata.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dataTable.html data sets] as needed. This feature requires perl, which comes with all MATLAB installations and linux distributions. If you are running Octave under windows, you may need to [http://www.perl.com/download.csp install perl], or download the data manually from [http://code.google.com/p/pmtkdata/downloads/list here], and add it to the pmtk3\data directory. Alternatively, you can check out the data from the
[http://pmtkData.googlecode.com pmtkData svn repository].
