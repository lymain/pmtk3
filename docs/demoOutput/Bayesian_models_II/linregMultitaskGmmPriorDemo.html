Warning: Could not find an exact
(case-sensitive) match for 'gaussLogProb'.
C:\pmtk3\toolbox\The_multivariate_Gaussian\gaussLogprob.m
is a case-insensitive match and will be used
instead.
You can improve the performance of your code
by using exact
name matches and we therefore recommend that
you update your
usage accordingly. Alternatively, you can
disable this warning using
warning('off','MATLAB:dispatcher:InexactCaseMatch').
This warning will become an error in future
